      <description>One of my major bugbears in Home Assistant (HASS) has always been that some integrations offer no proper way to completely delete a device or entity.
It seems so odd to me that in some cases there is no functionality beyond &amp;ldquo;disable&amp;rdquo;.
Info It&amp;rsquo;s been pointed out to me that this is only true for entities which are available. For those which are marked &amp;ldquo;unavailable&amp;rdquo;, there is an option to delete.</description>

      <title>Flashing ESPHome Firmware to ESP-01S</title>

      <description>I recently came across a listing on AliExpress for an ESP-01S (an ESP8266-based chip) and AM2302 combination. You&amp;rsquo;ll want the option named &amp;ldquo;AM2302 ESP-01S&amp;rdquo;. This is also available here, on Amazon UK, for a little more, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to get it faster.
At $4.38/ea (~Â£3.60) plus shipping I couldn&amp;rsquo;t say no, so I decided to buy a bunch of them to monitor the temperature and humidity in various locations around the house.</description>
