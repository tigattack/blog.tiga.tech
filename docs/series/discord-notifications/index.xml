      <description>Part 1 of a Discord notifications series.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had this running for a while and it works flawlessly, I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased with it.
After having a few people ask me how it&amp;rsquo;s done I decided it&amp;rsquo;d be best to make a post.
This is made extremely simple thanks to Sonarr&amp;rsquo;s built-in support for Slack notifications and Discord&amp;rsquo;s built-in support for Slack webhooks. Of course Radarr and Lidarr support this too, as they are forks of Sonarr.</description>
