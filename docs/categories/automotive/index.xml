      <description>After buying my Bora, which I wrote about here, I decided to carry out a number of repairs and upgrades.

Modifications &amp;amp; Upgrades Repairs Future Plans Modifications &amp;amp; Upgrades Replaced rear shocks and top mounts with Bilstein and OEM parts respectively. Cost-free as these were from my Golf and had only seen ~100 miles. Fitted Passat auto-dimming rearview mirror as an upgrade to the Bora auto-dimming mirror.</description>
