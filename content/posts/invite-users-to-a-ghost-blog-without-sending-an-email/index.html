<p>The Ghost platform makes it all but impossible to add new users if you don't have a mail server configured.<br>
In this post, I will show you how to work around this and add new users without needing to send an email.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>SELECT</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> permissions on the database backing Ghost. If you set Ghost up yourself, you will have this.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="part1inviteuser">Part 1 - Invite User</h1>
<ol>
<li>Log into your Ghost blog.</li>
<li>Go to the &quot;Staff&quot; section.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Invite People&quot;.</li>
<li>Insert a dummy email and the role you'd like the user to have, then click &quot;Send invitation now&quot;.<br>

Note: You'll probably see an error after you've submitted the invitation. You can safely ignore this.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Connect to a shell on the server hosting your Ghost site.</li>
<li>Run the following command: <code>mysql -u &lt;user&gt; -p</code><br>
And then enter the password.<br>

<li>Ghost's database is most likely named <code>ghost_prod</code>, but run the following command to make sure: <code>SHOW DATABASES;</code></li>
<li>Run the following command to tell MySQL that you're operating on the Ghost database: <code>USE ghost_prod;</code>. Replace <code>ghost_prod</code> with the name of your Ghost database if it differs.</li>
<li>You need to tell Ghost that the invitation has been sent, otherwise the invitation will remain invalid: <code>UPDATE invites SET status='sent';</code></li>
<li>Now run <code>SELECT email,token FROM invites;</code>. The invitation token is the important part. You want all of it <strong>except</strong> for the <code>=</code> (or <code>==</code> in some cases) at the end.<br>

<li>Replacing &lt;token&gt; with the token from the output of the last command and &lt;your-blog-address&gt; with your site's address (e.g. blog.tiga.tech), send the following URL to the user:<br>
https://&lt;your-site-address&gt;/ghost/#/signup/&lt;token&gt;<br>
