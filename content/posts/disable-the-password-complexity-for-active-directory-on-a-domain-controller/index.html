<p>I recently ran into an issue where I couldn't change the password of an account in AD from one of the Domain Controllers. I realised it's because it has a different Group Policy than other computers.</p>
<p>Run &gt; <code>gpmc.msc</code><br>
Expand your forest, expand the Domains container, expand your domain, and then right click on the Domain Controllers container.<br>
Pick <em>&quot;Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here...&quot;</em>.<br>
Pick a name for your GPO (e.g. <em>&quot;Disable Password Complexity Rules&quot;</em>) and click OK.<br>

<p>Expand the Domain Controllers container, right click on your new policy, and pick <em>&quot;Edit...&quot;</em>.<br>
Navigate through <mark>Computer Configuration &gt; Policies &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Account Policies</mark>.<br>
Open the policy named <em>&quot;Password must meet complexity requirements&quot;</em> and set it to Disabled.<br>

<p>The policy is now set, and all you need to do is run gpupdate.</p>
<p>Run &gt; <code>cmd</code><br>
Type <code>gpupdate</code>, hit enter, and wait for it to complete. It'll only take a few seconds.<br>

<p><strong>Once gpupdate has completed, you're all set.</strong></p>
