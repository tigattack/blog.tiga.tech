<p>Those of you who rarely perform a full shutdown or reboot on your MacBook may occasionally encounter issues with the Touch Bar.</p>
<p>One such issue is stuck keys.<br>
Unfortunately for me my escape key happened to jam on, so I couldn't use some applications, and couldn't even access the menu to perform power operations!</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a fix for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Launchpad by pinching inwards on the touchpad with your thumb and three fingers.</li>
<li>Open Terminal.</li>
<li>Run <code>killall ControlStrip &amp;&amp; pkill &quot;Touch Bar Agent&quot;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If you receive a permission-related failure, run the following command instead: <code>sudo killall ControlStrip &amp;&amp; sudo pkill &quot;Touch Bar Agent&quot;</code></p>
<p>Some of the keys on the Touch Bar will disappear for a moment.<br>
After this, it should be good as gold!</p>
