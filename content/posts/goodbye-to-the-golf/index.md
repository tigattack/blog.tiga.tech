# The Crash

8th September 2018

The day started pretty normally, we were woken up by the cat walking all over us in a beg for attention.

We were leaving for my girlfriend's little brother's hockey match. Within a quarter of a mile there's a section of road that splits from one lane into four, widening for a major junction ahead. Just after the lane splits to four, there's a small residential road on the right, across another two lanes of traffic coming in the other direction.

I'm doing my best to explain this in words but I've made an (admittedly shit) diagram to help illustrate.

I was to turn right at this junction, so I was in the far right lane. Unbeknownst to me, there was a Suzuki Wagon R behind me and to the left, in the far left lane.

The Suzuki driver decided she wanted to turn right into the small residential road. It was a last minute realisation//decision for her, and she jumped across 3 lanes in a matter of seconds. I caught a glimpse as she was heading for me, a split second before she slammed into the side of me.

I was spun round 90Â° and ended up 2.5 lanes over to the left, halfway between the two leftmost lanes.

Enough talking, here's the aftermath.

Note the difference in colour between the front bumper of the Suzuki and the rest of the body. This makes me think this isn't the driver's first accident.

# History of the Golf

I had some amazing times in and with this car. Below you can see where it started, only a few days after I bought it. Bone stock but I was the second owner, the car had full dealership service history, and 12 months MOT to boot. I was very pleased.

I had a spot of bad luck, as you can see in the fourth image. I was parked outside a friend's flat in London and somebody broke into the car overnight. Unfortunately some things were stolen from the boot, but nothing highly valuable. Live and learn.

It was an amazing second car. I adored every single minute I spent working on and driving it, and it'll be hard to say goodbye, but all good things must come to an end.

So, before you've even had a chance to say hello (I really did plan to make more car-related posts here), say goodbye to the Golf.

Next up... Watch this space!
