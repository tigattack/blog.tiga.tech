<p>8th September 2018</p>
<p>The day started pretty normally, we were woken up by the cat walking all over us in a beg for attention.</p>
<p>I had no idea this was coming, but I suppose you never do.</p>
<p>We were leaving for my girlfriend's little brother's hockey match. I drove down the hill, pulled out of the junction, and began heading towards [redacted].</p>
<p>Within a quarter of a mile there's a section of road that splits from one lane into four, in preparation for a major junction ahead. Just after the lane splits to four, there's a small residential road on the right, across another two lanes of traffic coming in the other direction.</p>
<p>I'm doing my best to explain this in words but I've made an (admittedly shit) diagram to help illustrate.</p>
<p>I was to turn right at this junction, so I was in the far right lane. Unbeknownst to me, there was a Suzuki Wagon R behind me and to the left, in the far left lane.</p>
<p>The Suzuki driver decided she wanted to turn right into the small residential road. It was a last minute realisation//decision for her, and she jumped across 3 lanes in a matter of seconds. I caught a glimpse as she was heading for me, a split second before she slammed into the side of me.</p>

<p>I was span around by 90Â° and ended up 2.5 lanes over to the left, between the far left lane and the one next to it.</p>
<p>Enough talking, here's the after-math.</p>

<p>Note the difference in colour between the front bumper of the Suzuki and the rest of the body. This makes me think this isn't the driver's first accident.</p>
<h2 id="historyofthegolf">History of the Golf</h2>
<p>I had some amazing times in and with this car. Below you can see where it started, only a few days after I bought it. Bone stock but I was the second owner, the car had full dealership service history, and 12 months MOT to boot. I was very pleased.</p>
<p>I had a spot of bad luck, as you can see in the fourth image. I was parked outside a friend's flat in London and somebody broke into the car overnight. Unfortunately some things were stolen from the boot, but nothing highly valuable. Live and learn.</p>

<p>It was an amazing second car. I adored every single minute I spent working on and driving it, and it'll be hard to say goodbye, but all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>So, before you've even had a chance to say hello (I really should've made more car-related posts here), say goodbye to the Golf.</p>
