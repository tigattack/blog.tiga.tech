Since I bought my E92 335i back in May 2024, I've done a decent number of repairs and maintenance items. I gave a brief summary of these in a recent post where I wrote about buying it:

{{< article link="/posts/new-car-bmw-335i-e92/">}}
<br>

There were a few small things that needed to be done when I first bought the car, and a few other repair items came up over the following 8 months and ~5,000 miles (~8,000 km).

Here I'll write about my process and experience of carrying out these repairs and a couple of additional maintenance items I chose to do.

# Pre-existing Repair Items

If you read my [first post on the 335i](/posts/new-car-bmw-335i-e92/), you'll remember that I identified three existing issues when I first bought the car:

* Offside front lower suspension arm.
* Offside front wheel bearing.
* Small oil leak from the oil cooler. It is a BMW, after all — I wouldn't trust it if it weren't leaking a bit of oil.

These are all pretty simple fixes, and were great haggling material, so I wasn't too fussed. Without further ado, let's get fixing!

## Offside Front Control Arm

***18/05/2024***

As I mentioned in my [previous post about the 335i](/posts/new-car-bmw-335i-e92/), these cars have a pretty interesting suspension setup[^1] that I hadn't seen before. It's not exactly rare or unique, but it was new to me, so I was intrigued by it nonetheless.

Each front corner has two lower arms (thrust arm and control arm) and then the usual damper strut (i.e. shock absorber strut) and track rod as seen in basically every other car.

* The thrust arm connects the upper, front part of the hub carrier to the front cross member.
* The control arm connects the lower, rear part of the hub carrier to the centre cross member.
* The damper strut, other than damping, serves to locate the upper part of the suspension.
* The track rod connects the hub carrier to the steering rack and facilitates... steering.

In this case, the repair item noted on the {{< tooltip text="MOT" tip="The UK's mandatory annual vehicle safety inspection" >}} for the "offside front lower suspension arm" was referring to the control arm.


Replacement is a simple procedure, albeit a little time-consuming and mildly irritating, as should be expected when dealing with running gear on older cars.

## Offside Front Wheel Bearing

***23/05/2024***

This was a super simple job, made even easier by the fact that the wheel bearing is captured in the hub[^1].

I'm sure many people have mixed feelings on this, given that it essentially forces replacement of two components when only one may be necessary. I agree with this, but to be honest I was glad of it in this case as it made the job a lot easier (albeit a little more expensive).

One of the bolts for the hub is obscured by the bottom end of the damper strut, so I picked up a set of [wobble sockets](https://olsatools.com/blogs/olsa-tools-blog/wobble-socket-extension) for this job.

I didn't strictly need the wobble sockets, I could've loosened the damper strut collar on the hub carrier, sprung it open with a special tool (I forget the name) and shifted the strut up a little to clear the bolt head, but:

1. I imagined it would be useful to have a set of wobble sockets, having been in many situations in the past where it would've helped me out.
2. It was a whole lot easier than shifting a damper strut that's been moulded into place with years worth of driving and road dirt.

# Newer Repair & Maintenance Items

## The _Might As Well While I'm In There™_ Saga

The next few repairs got a little out of hand thanks to my *might as well while I'm in there™* approach. Y'know, the classic. This became a recurring theme.

On a short drive home from town with some friends, one of the plastic flanges on the radiator top hose[^2] split in half. I had little choice but to call for roadside recovery, being too far from home to risk the drive with no coolant.

They got me going again by repairing the broken flange with some form of plastic glue. Whilst this allowed me to get home, it also littered my cooling system with small flakes of the hardened glue. Gross.

Naturally, this necessitated a full flush of the system.

As these things so often go, this quite quickly spiralled into several more jobs. We'll look at the radiator hoses first[^3] and the rest will follow.

### Radiator Hoses

***01/06/2024 – 17/06/2024***

This was the easy one; simple stuff and satisfying to get done.

I drained all the coolant via the {{< tooltip text="AT" tip="Automatic Transmission" >}} oil cooler[^2]. It's one of the lowest points of the cooling system, being fed off the heater return to thermostat hose under the engine, which will help me to drain as much of the system as possible.

{{< img src="hoses/20240601_164723.jpg"
    caption="The coolant hose I removed from the AT cooler to drain coolant." >}}

During one of the other tasks that span off this one, the radiator vent hose[^2] split. This is an even smaller, even crappier, even more plasticy-er (definitely a word) pipe running over the top of the radiator between the expansion tank and the top radiator hose:

{{< img src="hoses/20240601_191454.jpg" >}}

While a repair or replacement could quite easily be DIY'd[^4] for this, I was already buying quite a few other parts, so I just threw in an {{< tooltip text="OEM" tip="Original Equipment Manufacturer — A company that makes the OE (Original Equipment, i.e. genuine BMW) parts, just without the BMW logo on them." >}} replacement.

After receiving both replacement hoses and completing the other tasks below, I fitted them and did [several flushes of the cooling system](#oil-and-coolant) to remove all traces of the aforementioned flakes of glue.

{{< img src="hoses/20240603_085408.jpg"
    caption="Replacement top radiator hose fitted." >}}

During all the other tasks below, I ended up removing and re-fitting the cylinder head to thermostat (T-stat) coolant hose[^2] a number of times. The flange O-ring on the cylinder head side wasn't so happy after all that and sprung a small leak after the first run. This is the sort of thing I'm happy to get from a dealer as the markup isn't usually vastly more than you'll find elsewhere, and it's incredibly convenient.

I later learned that this hose's original plastic flange, colloquially known as the "Mickey Mouse flange" due to its shape, is somewhat famous for breaking. It fits directly into the cylinder head, therefore experiencing quite extreme heat cycles. Since the {{< tooltip text="OEM" tip="Original Equipment Manufacturer — A company that makes the OE (Original Equipment, i.e. genuine BMW) parts, just without the BMW logo on them." >}} flange is plastic (WTF?!), it deteriorates *fast* compared to most other flanges in the cooling system. As a result, an [aftermarket, aluminium version of the flange](https://teamrpm.nl/products/n55-n54-coolant-flange-aluminium-pre-order) is one of the most common preventative maintenance items recommended for the {{< tooltip text="N54" tip="The engine found in the E9x 335i, E8x 135i, E6x 535i, and more." >}}. Thankfully, a previous owner had already done this. Love to see it.

Anyway, a trip to the dealer, £3.42, and 5-minutes with a ratchet later, the hose fitting was water tight.

### Oil Filter Housing & Oil Cooler Thermostat Housing Gaskets

***01/06/2024 – 17/06/2024***

I was already planning to replace the {{< tooltip text="OFH/OCTH" tip="Oil filter housing & oil cooler thermostat housing" >}} (mated units) gaskets *soon™* but hadn't got round to it as it wasn't super crucial. If the wrong gasket goes bad in these, you'll start to see oil mixing with coolant. Thankfully that was not the case here.

However, when the radiator top hose, which connects directly to the {{< tooltip text="OFH" tip="Oil filter housing" >}}, blew out I decided I may as well get those gaskets sorted *while I was in there™*.

One of the oil leaks from the {{< tooltip text="OFH/OCTH" tip="Oil filter housing & oil cooler thermostat housing" >}} was from the {{< tooltip text="OCT" tip="Oil cooler thermostat" >}} cap. Despite my mention of the good history of this car in my [previous post on the 335i](/posts/new-car-bmw-335i-e92/), I found that a previous owner had implemented a truly shameful bodge-job repair for this specific leak; instead of doing what needed to be done, they had simply taken off the cap, coated the thing in some form of silicone sealant, and popped it back on.

{{< img src="ofh_oc_gaskets/20240603_085403.jpg"
    caption="A previous owners' \"repair\" on the {{< tooltip text=\"OCT\" tip=\"Oil cooler thermostat\" >}} cap (left) and a possible leak from oil cooler pipe flange seals (bottom)." >}}

Now, in defence of this move, BMW don't have a part number for the {{< tooltip text="OCT" tip="Oil cooler thermostat" >}} cap O-ring, and neither they nor any third-parties (bar a few Bimmerpost forum members in far-away countries) sell a replacement.

Thankfully, I was able to track down the exact spec of the O-ring[^5] and found a suitable replacement on eBay.

I purchased replacements for all the O-rings and gaskets in and around the {{< tooltip text="OFH/OCTH" tip="Oil filter housing & oil cooler thermostat housing" >}}:

* O-ring for the {{< tooltip text="OCT" tip="Oil cooler thermostat" >}} cap[^5].
* O-rings for the {{< tooltip text="OC" tip="Oil cooler" >}} pipe flanges on the {{< tooltip text="OCTH" tip="Oil cooler thermostat housing" >}} side[^6].
* Gasket for the mating surface between the {{< tooltip text="OFH/OCTH" tip="Oil filter housing & oil cooler thermostat housing" >}}[^6].
* Gasket for the mating surface between the {{< tooltip text="OFH" tip="Oil filter housing" >}} and cylinder head[^6].

After receiving the parts, I proceeded to remove and tear down the units. Removing the {{< tooltip text="OFH/OCTH" tip="Oil filter housing & oil cooler thermostat housing" >}} was more difficult than I imagined, with one of the bolts securing the {{< tooltip text="OFH" tip="Oil filter housing" >}} to the cylinder head being obscured by the intake manifold, but it was all plain sailing after getting around that.

</figure>

After splitting the {{< tooltip text="OFH/OCTH" tip="Oil filter housing & oil cooler thermostat housing" >}} and cleaning them up inside and out, I turned my attention to that bodged "fix" on the {{< tooltip text="OCT" tip="Oil cooler thermostat" >}} cap.

    <figcaption>{{< tooltip text="OCT" tip="Oil cooler thermostat" >}} cap before and after cleaning the old silicone sealant off and replacing the O-ring. Note how flattened the old O-ring was.</figcaption>
</figure>

As noted above, I used a generic Viton O-ring[^5] to replace the original O-ring for the {{< tooltip text="OCT" tip="Oil cooler thermostat" >}} cap. I believe the {{< tooltip text="OEM" tip="Original Equipment Manufacturer — A company that makes the OE (Original Equipment, i.e. genuine BMW) parts, just without the BMW logo on them." >}}-spec part is actually an almost-square (chamfered edges) "O"-ring, but the standard circular one I purchased fit like a glove and has yet to show any signs of leakage over the last ~5,000 miles (~8,000 km) of often-spirited driving.

With the {{< tooltip text="OFH/OCTH" tip="Oil filter housing & oil cooler thermostat housing" >}} now being nicely cleaned up and put back together with all new seals, I fitted it back onto the block and re-fitted the oil cooler pipes after replacing both O-rings.

### Serpentine Belt, Tensioner, Idler Pulleys

***01/06/2024 – 17/06/2024***

I hadn't been planning to do this one, but in doing the {{< tooltip text="OFH/OCTH" tip="Oil filter housing & oil cooler thermostat housing" >}} seals I realised that the extent of the oil leak was, whilst not egregious, a little worse than I'd thought.

This is a problem for the serpentine belt for two reasons:

1. Oil degrades rubber. I'd far rather spend a little to replace the belt and know it's OK than let a belt of unknown quality potentially cause me a huge problem at the worst time.
2. The N54 engine, among others, is known for its propensity to eat belts. So much so, in fact, that there are a plethora of aftermarket crank seal guards available. For example, this [VTT crank seal guard from ML Performance](https://www.mlperformance.co.uk/products/vtt-bmw-n54-n55-s55-billet-crank-seal-guard) (not sponsored).  
   If the serpentine belt fails, there's a strong chance it'll get sucked behind the front crankshaft pulley, and subsequently pushed past the crank seal and into the oil pan. Once in the oil pan, it can get pulled into the oil pick-up, almost certainly resulting in catastrophic engine failure. Fun!

The belt appeared to be fine upon inspection, however, as I'm quite partial to doing what I can to avoid a chance of catastrophic engine failure, I decided I'd replace it anyway.

Naturally, where my mind went next was *"hey, if I'm doing the serpentine belt, I may as well do the tensioner and pulleys while I'm in there™, right?"*

There wasn't a hint of any problems from any of these additional components but what the hell, why not?

Whilst it's not impossible to swap any of those components without doing so, pulling the radiator fan out gives you a lot more room to work with and makes this task far easier.

I was glad to discover how simple it was to pull the fan; I'm writing this some time later, but as I recall there was nothing but a screw or two and a couple of plastic clips in the way of removing it.

All in all, swapping the belt, tensioner, and idler pulleys was super simple. I'm not sure what I expected (more pain, I suppose), but it was a good experience.

I don't have any pictures from this job, so instead I shall throw in bonus picture of a subset of the collection of old and new parts scattered around my garage during these last couple of weeks:

{{< img src="misc/parts_mess.jpg" alt="Mess of car parts" >}}

### Oil, Oil Filter, and Coolant

***01/06/2024 – 17/06/2024***

This is it, the final *while I'm in there™* task that started with a blown radiator hose flange.

There's not a whole lot to say as these three were all quite obvious things to do, and almost unavoidable for that matter, given everything else I did.

After a frankly ridiculous amount of deliberation and research, I purchased 10L of Motul 8100 X-Clean 5W-40 oil.

This choice was not a result of my research, instead simply a result of a good deal on known-good oil, because as it turns out it's almost completely pointless researching oils unless you have a degree in chemistry or a penchant for arguing with strangers on the internet. Why do I never seem to learn this lesson?

Armed with the aforementioned oil, a new MANN oil filter, 5L of G11-spec antifreeze concentrate, 20L of deionised water (the majority of which was for flushing purposes), and a new oil pan plug washer, I got to work.

As I mentioned [above](#radiator-hoses), I drained the coolant from the coolant hose running to the {{< tooltip text="AT" tip="Automatic Transmission" >}} oil cooler[^2] as this is one of the lowest areas of the cooling system.

<figure>
    {{< gallery >}}

    {{< /gallery >}}
    <figcaption>Draining oil, highlighting the AT cooler coolant hose, and a fresh oil filter.</figcaption>
</figure>

It took quite a lot of flushing to get all the gunk ([see above](#the-_might-as-well-while-im-in-there_-saga)) out of the cooling system, but after seeing nothing for a few flushes in a row, I was happy.

After the flush, there was little to do but mix and fill the deionised water and antifreeze concentrate, fill the oil, screw in the new filter, and sit back with a cuppa. A touch clichéd perhaps, but that's what I did 🤷

## Coolant Expansion Tank

***20/06/2024***

This was no biggy, and wasn't even strictly necessary, but I noticed whilst flushing my coolant that the plastic fill level indicator had broken off in my coolant expansion tank.

I'm convinced I'd seen it there before, ruling out a likely chance of it having broken off before my ownership, and equally convinced that it wasn't I who broke it. I suspect it was the roadside recovery mechanic.

Games of "whodunnit" aside, I purchased a replacement tank from a breaker on eBay for £14.95, taken from an E8x 1 Series. Bargain!

Three days later a friendly local courier lobbed it over my back gate with all the force of a M270B1 MLRS unit. Once unwrapped and inspected for the damage I was convinced would be there, but through some stroke of luck was not, it took me all of 10 minutes to swap.

Love an easy job 😄

Being such a simple job, I also have no pictures from this one and shall once again throw in a bonus picture of a new toolbox I got during these couple of weeks of work on the car. After a bit of haggling I got it for £70, sold by a local mechanic who'd upgraded some of his workshop.

{{< img src="misc/toolbox.jpg" class="grid-w75" alt="Wheeled toolbox" >}}

## Wheel Alignment

***20/06/2024***

Having no knowledge of when an alignment was last done, and having replaced a control arm and wheel hub & bearing recently, I figured it wouldn't hurt to get a wheel alignment done.

A particularly well stuck track rod arm on the nearside front made it difficult to adjust. In all honesty, I'm writing this so many months after the fact that I struggle to recall how much, or if at all, they were able to adjust the toe on that corner. The results would suggest there was some movement, though:

{{< img src="misc/alignment.png" class="grid-w75" watermark_position="left" >}}

To be honest I wasn't particularly happy with the alignment as they pretty much entirely ignored the rear of the car. However, I shall let more intelligent minds be the judge as I know very little in terms of optimum wheel geometry; I just see colours on a print-out.

That said, I felt like the car handled and stuck to its lines better after the alignment. This could well be a case of perception bias, but I suppose we'll never know.

## Rear Shock Absorbers

***16/12/2024***

This was a fun one! During a drive home from a hike with my partner, the nearside rear shock absorber top mount self-destructed, resulting in this lovely situation:

{{< img src="rear_shocks/20241208_172639.jpg"
    caption="Spoiler alert: It shouldn't look like that." >}}

Now, this happened late on a Sunday afternoon, and while I didn't have the necessary tools with me to remove trim pieces and visually inspect the issue, it was fairly clear what had happened. Given it was nothing truly catastrophic, there was no way I was waiting around for the 2+ hours until roadside recovery could turn up, for my partner's sake even if not my own.

With that in mind, I gingerly crawled the 335i home, all the while trying to ignore the utterly sinful banging and rattling noises coming from the loose shock doing its best wacky waving inflatable arm-flailing tube man impression[^7] in its seat. Putting to use as best I could my mental map of Bristol's most potholed and bump-ridden roads, we got home with no further damage.

To be honest, this failure so ridiculously unceremonious that it was just quite funny... At least, after my initial worry that I'd punched a hole in the underside of the body 😬

As I clearly needed to replace one shock, it only made sense to replace both, especially given that I had no idea of the age or mileage of either of them.

My 335i came with the M-Sport suspension package from factory, so I had to be a little careful in selecting the correct components. The vast majority of locally-available parts were not suitable.

In the end, I picked up the following parts from a combination of eBay and a local independent distributor:

* Sachs 311410 shock absorber[^8] x2
* Sachs 900127 dust cover[^8] kit — Includes two bump stops and dust covers.
* KYB SM5752 top mount kit[^8] x2 — Includes the supporting cup, sealing grommet, and both guide supports.

After getting my hands on the parts, I proceeded to remove and replace each shock absorber in turn. I spent a good while cocking around with a ratchet and a spanner, and resultingly made a spanner of myself:

    {{< /gallery >}}
    <figcaption>The hex shaft on top of the strut, required to stop it rotating when the top mount nut is being rotated, sheared off.</figcaption>
</figure>

I tried using various mole grips and other such tools to block the shaft from rotating whilst removing the top nut, but unfortunately to no avail. After this, I was frustrated and at a loss, and took a break for the evening. Talking with a friend that evening, he suggested using the impact wrench. I was convinced this wouldn't work, given that the strut rotates freely and requires counter-pressure to stop it, but I didn't have any better ideas.

At first, I wasn't able to get my impact wrench on to the top nut of the strut due to the limited vertical space in the boot of coupés. After numerous attempts to reposition the lower end of the strut, I finally got it into a (slightly sketchy) position which allowed me to fit my impact wrench onto the top nut, and what do you know, it whipped the bolt right off!

Boy was I in for a sight when I got the broken shock off and took a look at it:

{{< gallery >}}
    {{< img src="rear_shocks/20241213_133225.jpg" class="grid-w33" >}}

    {{< img src="rear_shocks/20241213_160012.jpg" class="grid-w33" >}}
{{< /gallery >}}

That thing was _fucked_.

Building and fitting the new shocks was mostly a breeze, the only tricky part being compressing them enough to get them over the track control arms. I later learned that there was a far easier way to do this... A lesson for the future.

## Offside Front Thrust Arm

***23/12/2024***

For a few weeks, I'd noticed a slight wobble at 60 MPH (~100 km/h) and above and heard knocks over bumps from the {{< tooltip text="OS/F" tip="Offside Front" >}} wheel area. After raising that corner and poking at various components, I noticed some pretty excessive movement from the thrust arm's[^1] inner bushing:

{{< video src="osf_thrust_arm/20241216_134628.webm" >}}

I was driving some distance to spend time with family over the holiday period the following day, but after seeing this I wanted to get it replaced ASAP, not only because there are some fantastic roads around where my parents live.

Luckily it's a super simple replacement with nothing but two large bolts to deal with. I picked up a replacement part (albeit not one from an {{< tooltip text="OEM" tip="Original Equipment Manufacturer — A company that makes the OE (Original Equipment, i.e. genuine BMW) parts, just without the BMW logo on them." >}}) from a local distributor and got it replaced in no time.

    caption="A shameful amount of rust on some of these parts, mostly thanks to UK weather. Track rod arms are on my to-do list." >}}

# The End.

That's everything for now, but I did buy an almost two-decade old high-performance BMW, so I shall no doubt be back with more!
