<p>About a month and a half after the <a href="https://blog.tiga.tech/goodbye-to-the-golf/">Golf was taken out</a>, I bought a new car.</p>
<p>So remember how like four months ago I said &quot;Next up... Watch this space!&quot;?<br>
Well this took a little longer to put together than I hoped it would because... Well, I'm lazy.</p>
<p>If you're in a rush, I bought a 2004 VW Bora Sport with the PD130 engine. It was a bit of a chavved up mess and I fixed it. The end.<br>
If you've got some time, read on!</p>
<h5 id="buyingthebora">Buying the Bora</h5>
<h6 id="16102018">16/10/2018</h6>
<p>I found a VW Bora for sale on Facebook Marketplace.<br>
I ran the number plate to get the spec of the car along with MOT history and a HPI check. This all came up pretty good.<br>
As you'll see below, it was pretty distastefully modified. The good side of this was that I could use the stupid shit to knock the price down.</p>
<h6 id="17102018">17/10/2018</h6>
<p>I went to see it that evening, about a 1.5h drive from home at the other side Devon. My father drove me up so that I could drive the car back if I bought it.<br>
It was dark by the time we got there which I wasn't happy about, but I had brought bright lights to inspect the car and my laptop to find fault codes.</p>
<p>The body was in very good condition for the age. The only issue I could spot was the minuscule beginnings of a rust bubble on a rear arch, one or two small stone chips on one of the skirts, and a tiny dink on the os/r door.</p>
<p>After scanning the car's control modules for any issues I found there was an intermittent issue with one of the rear parking sensors and a constant issue with the driver's side door module, which meant the car didn't know when that door was open or not. Not a big issue and not hard to resolve.</p>
<p>I was happy with the car and bought it, after knocking the price down by 30% of course!</p>
<h5 id="aboutthebora">About the Bora</h5>
<p>The car is a 2004 VW Bora Sport with the PD130 (ASZ) engine.</p>
<h4 id="spec">Spec</h4>
<p>Hard to know what to list here, I don't want to waste time and space by listing every feature it has so I'll just include some of the things that were more &quot;fancy&quot; at the time of production, as things like ABS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traction_control_system">TCS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_stability_control">ESP</a>, A/C, alarm &amp; central locking, all electric windows, etc. are relatively basic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cruise control.</li>
<li>8-speaker audio system.<br>
It's not branded but, apart from high-end systems, it's some of the best factory audio I've experienced in a car.</li>
<li>Automatic windscreen wipers.</li>
<li>Automatic dimming rearview mirror.</li>
<li>Leather seats with adjustable lumbar support.</li>
<li>Heated seats.</li>
<li>Rear parking sensors.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="beforepurchase01120416102018">Before purchase (01/12/04 - 16/10/2018)</h6>
<p>I'm the 4th owner of the vehicle. Doesn't feel as special as it did on the Golf, of which I was the second owner.<br>
It's had a patchy service history but I've spent some time tracking down the history at a number of garages around the UK including Wales, East Midlands, Bristol, North Devon, and a few other places, and it's not as bad as it seems from the paperwork (but still not great).<br>
Whilst patchy, the service history isn't awful and the relatively low mileage makes me confident that there's still a good chance to take care of it properly and keep it going for a long time to come.</p>
<p>As you'll see in the list below, it had been pretty distastefully modified, but there were some silver linings to the cloud of distaste.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revo remap by GotBoost Performance, producing 171hp and 302lb/ft (from stock figures of 130hp and 229lb/ft).</li>
<li>Unknown coilovers. Lowered to the floor so it knocked everywhere and scraped the ground.</li>
<li>Aftermarket mini-ducktail spoiler.</li>
<li>Audi TT front anti-roll bar.</li>
<li>BBS Super RS reps.</li>
<li>Gold &quot;JDM&quot; gear knob.</li>
<li>Philips double DIN touchscreen head unit.</li>
<li>Muffler delete (straight pipe cat-back).</li>
<li>5% tint on the 3 rear windows.</li>
<li>Hekko wind deflectors all round.</li>
<li>US-spec front bumper.</li>
<li>US-spec rear lights.</li>
<li>Dual-driver subwoofer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's some photos from just before and just after purchase:</p>

<p>There were a few issues upon purchasing, which I was aware of and partially what I used to get such a discount.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust bubbling on offside rear wheel arch.</li>
<li>Stone chips on nearside skirt.</li>
<li>Dink on os/r door.</li>
<li>1 of 4 rear parking sensors is faulty.</li>
<li>Offside front door control module is dead.</li>
<li>Driveshafts are completely shagged due to how low the car is.</li>
<li>Air from the vents smelled disgusting, regardless of set temperature, mode or A/C state.</li>
<li>Squealing whilst steering at low revs.</li>
<li>Master window switch didn't work for one-touch up/down on both offside and nearside front windows (rears are not one-touch).</li>
<li>Front top mounts were shagged, along with one of the rear top mounts which I did not originally realise.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="afterpurchase17102018present">After purchase (17/10/2018 - Present)</h6>
<p>I carried out a number of repairs and upgrades after buying the car.<br>
I've detailed these in a separate post as adding them to this post was just making it huge.</p>
<p>If you're interested then please take a look <a href="https://blog.tiga.tech/upgrading-and-fixing-the-bora/">here</a>!</p>
<p>I often find large blog posts offputting unless I'm actually learning something, so I try to keep these as short as possible (although this is already a far cry from &quot;short&quot;).</p>
<p>Anyway, here's some photos from after I fixed it up a bit and de-chavved it:</p>
