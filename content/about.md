## Hi, I'm tigattack.

I live in Bristol, UK, and work as a Systems Engineer.

I have a keen interest in technology, almost anything automotive, mountain biking, and surfing, but I'll probably only post about the first two here.

Growing up in rural Devon in a low-tech family, I had little exposure to technology until I was a young teen, at which point I dove into it head-first and haven't looked back.

I discovered the concept of "[home-labbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction)" by accident when I was 16, after being given a mini PC with an Intel Atom\@1.2GHz and a whole 2GB RAM(!) I shoved a few 120GB spinners into it, and thus it all began.

Since then, I've expanded my lab to 3 sites, comprising a number of rack servers, mini PCs (slightly better than my first though), Raspberry Pi's, an HP Gen8 MicroServer, a custom/whitebox build, and so on.

When I'm not working or labbing, you're likely to find me under my car or out in the countryside.

Where you can find me:

* I have some cool [projects](/projects) on [GitHub](https://github.com/tigattack).
* I help maintain and can often be found in the [r/Homelab Discord](https://discord.gg/homelab).
* I have quite a lot of [Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/jzdq9f73omuknrr57rnsd3xxq?si=c63dcb8ffd3f4bac).
* You can see what I've been listening to recently on [Last.FM](https://last.fm/user/tigattack).
